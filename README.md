A sample book browser SPA written in AngularJs 1.4.

See a [working demo here](http://ditam.github.io/demos/bookBrowser/index.html).

After installing the dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`, run `grunt serve` to develop *(this is also the easiest way of trying out the working application, as it starts a local webserver)*, or `grunt build` to create a non-minified distributable folder.
