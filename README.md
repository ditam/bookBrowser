A sample book browser SPA written in AngularJs 1.4.

After installing the dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`, run `grunt serve` to develop *(this is also the easiest way of trying out the working application, as it starts a local webserver)*, or `grunt build` to create a minified distributable.
